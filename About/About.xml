  <description>Allows you to hide colonists from your colonist bar, decreasing clutter.
How it works:
- Right click on your colonist bar (even if all colonists have been removed).
- Click "Manage colonist bar...".
- Click "Restore" or "Remove" on the appropriate colonist.
Compatible with save games. Hidden colonists are saved, even if you disable the mod between saves.
